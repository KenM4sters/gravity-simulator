            <h1> Introduction </h1>
            <p>In this simulation, two particles of equal mass share the same initial x and z velocities. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of this, they're equally attracted to each other and are locked in a symetrical binary orbit,
                where, at any point in time, they share exactly the same speed. 
            </p>
            <p> This simulation assumes zero vertical acceleration, and uses Isaac Newton's law of Universal Gravitation,
                amongst other formulea to calculate the acceleration vectors of each particle on each frame. 
            </p>
            <p>The result is a realistic demonstration of how two particles interact with each other gravitationally.</p>
